        <h1>Stairway to Heaven</h1>
        <address>Led Zeppelin</address>
        <p>
        There's a lady who's sure<br>
        All that glitters is gold<br>
        And she's buying a stairway to heaven<br>
        When she gets there she knows<br>
        If the stores are all closed<br>
        With a word she can get what she came for<br>
        Oh oh oh oh and she's buying a stairway to heaven<br>
        <br>
        There's a sign on the wall<br>
        But she wants to be sure<br>
        'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings<br>
        In a tree by the brook<br>
        There's a songbird who sings<br>
        Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiving<br>
        <br>
        Ooh, it makes me wonder<br>
        Ooh, it makes me wonder<br>
        <br>
        There's a feeling I get<br>
        When I look to the west<br>
        And my spirit is crying for leaving<br>
        In my thoughts I have seen<br>
        Rings of smoke through the trees<br>
        And the voices of those who standing looking<br>
        <br>
        Ooh, it makes me wonder<br>
        Ooh, it really makes me wonder<br>
